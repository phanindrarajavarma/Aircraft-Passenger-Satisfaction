Problem Statement
Airline customer satisfaction is pivotal for the growth of airline companies. This project aims to analyze key variables affecting customer satisfaction and predict methods to enhance sales based on satisfaction. The primary objective is to predict customer satisfaction using machine learning algorithms.

Data Overview
Dataset: [Provide details or link to the dataset]
Rows: 129880
Columns: 25 (5 numerical, 20 categorical)
Response Variable: Categorical (0 and 1) denoting satisfaction
Key Steps
Data Cleaning and Exploration:

Identification and handling of missing values and duplicates.
Exploratory data analysis to understand variable relationships.
Modeling:

Trained various models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, Na√Øve Bayes, SVM, and Neural Networks.
Evaluated model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Model Selection:

Analyzed model accuracy and runtime.
Selected Random Forest Classifier for its high accuracy and relatively lesser runtime.
GitHub Structure
Data: Contains the dataset and data cleaning scripts.
Notebooks: Jupyter notebooks detailing data exploration, model training, and evaluation.
Models: Saved model files and their associated metadata.
Results: Model performance metrics and visualizations.
Results and Impact
The project concluded with Random Forest Classifier achieving the highest accuracy of 0.96. The models help predict customer satisfaction, enabling airlines to enhance areas that impact customer experience and satisfaction.
